### GEO1101-2023 Group 4 - Pointcloud based anatomy

___

In this project, we implemented:

- the selection tool;
- the annotation tool;
- the anonymization tool.

All the above functions are developed under [Potree v1.7](https://github.com/potree/potree/tree/1.7/) framework and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

1. Selection tool

   The selection tool consists of three parts, Lasso selection, Layers control system, and Data export.
